But now to my letter -- to yours 't is an answer -- To-morrow be with me , as soon as you can , sir , All ready and dress'd for proceeding to spunge on ( According to compact ) the wit in the dungeon [ 2 ] -- Pray Phoebus at length our political malice May not get us lodgings within the same palace !
I suppose that to-night you 're engaged with some codgers , And for Sotheby 's [ 3 ] Blues have deserted Sam Rogers ; And I , though with cold I have nearly my death got , Must put on my breeches , and wait on the Heathcote .
